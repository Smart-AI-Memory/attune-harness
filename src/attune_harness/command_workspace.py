"""The host that turns an adapter's state into one rendered, one-shot decision.

Carried from Attune AI (branch ``codex/shared-memory-adoption`` at
``b89f7953f``): ``attune/elicitation/command_workspace.py``, step 3.1 of the
spec authority's Task 3 (D14). Adapters own command state and its meaning.
The host owns adapter registration, workspace identity, revision and nonce
issuance, canonical storage, structural action validation, and at-most-once
publication of a transition. HTML and Markdown are disposable projections of
the same ``WorkspaceView``.

Three things differ from the original:

- **Events, not telemetry.** The original logged a render and an accept
  through ``attune_forms.form_events`` into Attune AI's home directory. Here
  the host takes an optional ``record_event`` callable and hands it the same
  two events; ``jsonl_event_writer`` appends them as JSON lines to a file the
  caller names, which the bridge will place beside the task's
  ``decision.json``. An event never carries the action nonce. A sink that
  fails is logged and counted in ``dropped_events``; it never blocks a
  decision.
- **Terminal workspaces are evicted.** The original kept every record and
  every ``asyncio.Lock`` for the life of the process. Here a workspace that
  reaches a terminal state is removed from both, and its id is kept in a
  bounded set so a replay is still refused with the original message.
- **The forms package loads on first use**, through ``features.require_feature``
  at the pinned version, as every other optional package in Harness does, so
  importing this module needs nothing installed.

The lock is what it always was: a guard against two coroutines in one process.
Refusal of a stale or replayed decision across processes is the task store's
job (``work_contract.bind_work_acceptance``), which D14 names as the authority.
