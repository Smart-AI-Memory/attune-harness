# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First PyPI release, alpha. The 0.1.0rc1 runtime plus one fix, with the final
version, a README written for the PyPI page, and per-command usage moved to
docs/cli-guide.md. Qualified on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows with Python 3.10 and
3.12. What is and is not qualified is listed in the README.

- Fixed: on Windows, saving a run record failed with `PersistenceError` whenever
  another process (`status`, an indexer, antivirus) briefly had `record.json`
  open, which stopped all further dispatch in the session. The save now retries
  the replace for up to two seconds before failing closed as before. A record
  held open for longer than that still fails the run.

## 0.1.0rc1

Provisional TestPyPI publishing rehearsal using the qualified release-gap
runtime snapshot. This checks package distribution, clean installation and CLI
behavior. Windows feature-effect support and final native release journeys
remain under qualification; this is not the production release.
